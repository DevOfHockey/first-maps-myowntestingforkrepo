The documentation is inside the file "How_to_use_the_app.md"

The folder called "How to use the app" contains the photos that the markdown file refers to. If you delete it, the photos will disappear from the docs. I wrote the docs in Notion and then exported them into markdown. 

Feel free to make any changes and add to the documentation as you wish. 

To view the markdown file in VS Code (for Mac): 
1. Have the file open, with your cursor on the file. 
2. Press Command + K
3. Press V
