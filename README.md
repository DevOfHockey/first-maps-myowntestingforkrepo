# First Maps

## What is First Maps?
First Maps is an interactive resource for indigenous community members and the general public to establish and strengthen connections in the spheres of culture, art and tourism.

## What is our purpose?
The purpose of First Maps is to allow the native community to showcase aboriginal arts, culture, language and history. Contributing members of the native community can add resources to the app for others to see. This is meant to be a resource for tourists, academics and anyone else who wish to gain a deeper understanding of native culture.

## Data
The location data in the application is seeded from the Native-Lands API: https://native-land.ca/resources/api-docs/
For demonstration, we only used locations that are within and near the province of British Columbia.
